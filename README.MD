# Turtle race

This is one of the first ever programming assignments I've ever done at the University of Minnesota. This little assignment meant a lot to me because it was how I first got started into coding. It's a cute little script that makes turtles race against each other.

Wanna take bets?

To compile and run this short python script, you can do it in 2 ways.
You can either open the shell and run the module then type 


```bash
race()
```

or you can just do this command

```
python3 turtle_race.py
```

and that will do the exact same thing


This isn't supposed to be a large project that I did, but a short and simple one that first got me into programming
